### ðŸ‘‹ Hello

I'm [**@derrickyoo**](https://twitter.com/derrickyoo), a software engineer, an entrepreneur, and a free-range human - roaming the tech entrepreneurial space in pursuit of building **community** and **meaningful** products using code, no-code, and automation tools.

Right now I'm working on [**Tinkerstack**](https://www.tinkerstack.com/), a developer blog and tutorial platform. I will be using Next.js/React as a means to learn something new in 2021. Other interests include SaaS, back-end architecture, and creating user-friendly interfaces.

I journey to #buildinpublic. All updates about my progress can be found on my [**site**](https://www.derrickyoo.com/). For all other inquires, reach out to me [**here**](mailto:hi@derrickyoo.com).

### ðŸ§° Tools

- ðŸ’– Python, Django, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue.js, Angular, etc.
- ðŸŒ± No-code tools and automations, FTW!
- ðŸš€ Let's start building
